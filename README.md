# drumkit-web-app
The point of this project is to have each key, when pressed, make a corresponding drum noise. It also uses CSS transitions and animations to make the project more interactive to the user. I completed this project earlier in my JavaScript learning phase. I found it quite confusing because I had never used the HTML audio API or the selection of DOM elements using the date-key attribute.
